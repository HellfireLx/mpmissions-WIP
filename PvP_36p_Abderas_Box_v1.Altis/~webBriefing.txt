[u][b]Event Goal[/u]:[/b]
The objective of PvP events is to have fun with each other, winning or losing as a team should not matter. We chose a rather short time period per event (60min) to lessen frustration of an early death. PvP events provide you with a spectator mode - if you get taken out early use the opportunity to observe the fights and learn from mistakes you or others made. ACRE2 has a hidden channel for "dead people", so you'll soon have somebody hanging about with you to talk and laugh without disturbing the in-game players. Please don't gloat or rage if teams get wrecked, instead reflect on mistakes and congratulate your fellow community members on clever maneuvers and tactics.
