[b][u]Situation[/u]:[/b]
A mobile NAS unit (a white STANAG ammocrate) with valuable Intel has been dragged to the village of Abderan by insurgents. The insurgents left, but didn't have the time to move the NAS unit with them. OpFor and BluFor are trying to acquire the Intel for themselves.

This is a symmetrical confrontation (1:1).

[b][u]Mission Objectives[/u]:[/b]
Primary: Secure the NAS and deny the opposite force access to it, while downloading the Intel. Due to its specific encryption method, the payload has to be downloaded all at once. Any interruption will result in the 
download process to be restarted.

[b][u]Area of Operations[/u]:[/b]
Abderan village

[b][u]Execution[/u]:[/b]
[b]Planning Phase(10 minutes)[/b]
Do not leave your base before 10 minutes are up. You may already mount vehicles during that phase.
[color=#dd2423][u]Important OpFor[/u][/color]: Consider a pilot, as a Ka-60 is OpFor's fast insertion asset.
[b]Fighting Phase (50 minutes)[/b]
The Intel must be seized before 60 minutes are up or it is a draw. At 45 minutes a reminder message will pop-up.
The village counts over 70 buildings. The NAS can be in any location in those buildings.
The download is activated through the scroll wheel menu item:[i] ##  Start data transmission now  ##[/i].
An approximate area of the location shows up on the map, while a download is active.

[u][b]Event Goal[/u]:[/b]
The objective of PvP events is to have fun with each other, winning or losing as a team should not matter. We chose a rather short time period per event (60min) to lessen frustration of an early death. PvP events provide you with a spectator mode - if you get taken out early use the opportunity to observe the fights and learn from mistakes you or others made. ACRE2 has a hidden channel for "dead people", so you'll soon have somebody hanging about with you to talk and laugh without disturbing the in-game players. Please don't gloat or rage if teams get wrecked, instead reflect on mistakes and congratulate your fellow community members on clever manoeuvres and tactics.
